By issuing unique API keys, the service providers can track and control usage, enforce rate limits, and prevent unauthorized access, which is crucial for maintaining security and managing resource allocation. Over time, an API key can become compromised or leaked, potentially leading to misuse, such as exceeding the allocated quota limit or incurring unexpected costs. Regularly regenerating the API key helps mitigate these risks by invalidating the old key and issuing a new one, thus effectively cutting off any unauthorized access that might have occurred due to the key's exposure. This practice ensures continued security and optimal usage of the LLM service by authorized users. To regenerate your keys:\n",
