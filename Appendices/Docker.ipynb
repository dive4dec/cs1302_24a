If you know about [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine), you may think of a docker container as a separate virtual machine running on your host machine, but with much less overhead. Indeed, you can also run the Jupyter server locally in your computer by installing Docker as follows."

    "\n",
    "A docker image is a the blueprint for creating Docker containers. When you run a Docker container, it is instantiated from an image. For example, `chungc/cs1302nb` is a docker image created from a text file [`Dockerfile.core`](https://github.com/dive4dec/jupyter/blob/main/cs1302nb/Dockerfile.core), which specifies how and why packages should be installed. The image was built using some [Make commands](https://github.com/dive4dec/jupyter/blob/main/README.md) in the repository. The resulting image was published to the public registry [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/chungc/cs1302nb/latest/images/sha256-c2a9745ba8febc5e22142811363bfa0941d3eafd2997d3c49df3c448fb424fea?context=repo).
